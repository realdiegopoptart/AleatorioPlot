# AleatorioPlot
According to Google Translate, Aleatorio means random, so the name of this project is literally 'RandomPlot'. That's exactly what this project is, a Random Plot Generator.

# Backstory
In the longest story ever, in short: Film teacher has these cards that you pull to come up with a random movie plot. So I decided to make an app out of it.
